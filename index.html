                <p class="chaln-p">Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, and economist, best
                    known as the pioneer of microcredit and microfinance. Born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong,
                    Bangladesh, he pursued his undergraduate studies at Dhaka University and later earned a PhD in
                    economics from Vanderbilt University, USA, through a Fulbright Scholarship. He also worked as an
                    assistant professor of economics at Tennessee State University before returning to Bangladesh to
                    serve as the head of the Economics Department at Chittagong University.In 1976, Dr. Yunus founded
                    Grameen Bank, introducing the concept of providing collateral-free microloans to impoverished
                    individuals, particularly women, to promote financial independence and reduce poverty. This
                    groundbreaking initiative became a global model for poverty alleviation. His efforts were recognized
                    worldwide, and in 2006, Dr. Yunus and Grameen Bank jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize for their
                    contributions to social and economic development.

                    Over the years, Dr. Yunus has received numerous other prestigious honors, including the Presidential
                    Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal from the United States. In August 2024, amidst
                    political unrest in Bangladesh, he took on the role of Chief Adviser of Bangladesh, stepping into
                    political leadership after decades of work in socioeconomic reform.</p>
